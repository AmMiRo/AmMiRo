# Hi, I'm [Amos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amos-rose/)!

I am a former healthcare professional turned software engineer.

## Here is a little about me

I worked in healthcare as a radiographer for over 10 years. Whether it was working on a trauma team in the emergency room, teaching and training clinical students, or collaborating on cross-functional teams in interventional procedures, I loved performing outstanding services and exams for my patients and care teams. While I was finding success in my field, I wanted to work in an environment where my creativity and drive to learn new technologies would be a greater asset to my professional development.
 
In late 2019 I decided to make a change and enrolled in BloomTech (at the time known as Lambda School) to learn full-stack web development. On top of software engineering, that experience showed me the value that my creativity and lifestyle of learning could bring.
 
I've been working as a software engineer ever since and have loved every opportunity to learn a new technology, collaborate to find a solution to a tricky problem, and deliver a feature that makes a real impact on the platform or application I'm working on.
